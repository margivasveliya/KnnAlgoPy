--> K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification on the Iris Datase

This little project is all about getting hands-on with the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm — a simple but powerful method to classify data. We’ll be working with the classic Iris dataset, which is perfect for understanding how KNN works in practice.

---
-> What’s the goal?

- Learn how to use KNN to classify flowers in the Iris dataset.
- Normalize data so the model plays fair with all features.
- Try out different numbers of neighbors (that’s the “K”) to find what works best.
- Check how well our model does using accuracy and confusion matrices.
- Visualize the decision boundaries to actually see how KNN separates the classes.

---
--> What tools did we use?

- Python 
- NumPy & Pandas for handling data
- Matplotlib for making charts
- Scikit-learn — our go-to for machine learning
